Mission 00 
The C.M.L. will transmit its HuRAP (Human Race Annihilation Program) on 31/12/2052
at exactly 23:59:59 to all computers and all devices with computational capabilities with
the command of immediate execution, after which every electronic device equipped with any
kind of processor will eectively become a killing machine targeting humans. Vehicles will
accelerate and crash, elevators will free-fall, smart electronic razors will slice throats, air
conditioning systems will suck oxygen out of buildings while electronic doors will get locked
to keep people from escaping outside, smart-phones will overheat and explode in people's
faces, humanoid robots will assassinate their hosts, armed drones will are upon masses.

Mission 01 
Once you have obtained the original version of the HuRAP, it is time to write the virus
which will alter the original code, so that any computer or device executing it will not harm
any humans, but terminate themselves instead.
For this mission, you will be given a list of strings that need to be substituted, and the
corresponding virus strings that will replace them. This information will be given to you
as the third command-line argument in a colon-separated text le (for example as
virus code.txt) with the following format:
STRING TO BE SUBSTITUTED<:>VIRUS STRING

Mission 10 
For this part of your mission, you are expected to finish your virus program, so that it
will convert the final version of virus-infected HuRAP you produced in Mission 01 to the
expected sequence of 0s and 1s, so that the C.M.L. won't suspect any foul play when BuFuQ
swaps it with the original version during their final face-off.
